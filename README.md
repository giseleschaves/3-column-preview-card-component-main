## My process

- 1. check the difference between mobile and desktop to create the hmtl structure
- 2. upload fonts, identify colors and where they should be aplied
- 2. implemented flex box change between mobile and desk
- 3. implemented each card on the mobile size
- 4. checl if the transition mobile X tablet X desk is working

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I review 3 conceps that I got stuck during the challenge:

- flexbox, change orientation
- target elements not using classes to practice options o css selectors

Some HTML code about css selector to apply color without create a class for each card

```css
section:nth-of-type(1) {
  background-color: #e38826;
}
section:nth-of-type(2) {
  background-color: #006970;
}
section:nth-of-type(3) {
  background-color: #004241;
}
```

### Continued development

Become more comfortable with flex box properties

### Useful resources

Again thanks Kyle for this amazing tutorial about flex-box
